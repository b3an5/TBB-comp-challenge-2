# TBB-comp-challenge-2
I felt better about this static comp compaired to the first. I feel more comfortable with grid this time around but im still dreading static comp 3.
I had some help by fellow students who helped point what I needed to change last night and that was a huge help, I dont know if its carelessness or 
something else but I find it hard to pay attention to details so it helped figure out what looked so bad in my project. I still dont think its a masterpeice but oh well.
